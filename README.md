## 🧭 What is Babel.Fish?  
Most systems can translate. Few can adapt.  

**Babel.Fish** is a multilingual AI pipeline that takes text and reshapes it for the audience:  
- Formal German for legal / business contexts 🇩🇪  
- Casual French for creative industries 🇫🇷  
- Investor-ready English for boardrooms 🇺🇸  
- And more…  

This isn’t “word swap translation.” It’s **cultural calibration.**

---

## 🚀 Features (Planned & Prototype)  
- 🌐 Translate between multiple languages (baseline).  
- 🎭 Switch tone (formal ↔ casual).  
- 🏢 Adapt text for **context**: technical docs, pitches, marketing.  
- 🔍 Style mirroring: adapt to the voice of an uploaded sample.  
- 🤖 Extendable to any LLM backend (OpenAI, Claude, local models).
